Built with React, Next.js, Tailwind, Stripe and TypeScript.

This mini project provides a pricing card that enables the
purchase of a single product without needing users to log in.
I used Stripe for creating the product and handling the payments
for the product. Since the product is set up with Stripe's test mode,
users can test the billing without being charged.

The site is deployed with Vercel.
