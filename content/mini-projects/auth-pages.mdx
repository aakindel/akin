Built with Next.js, Tailwind, NextAuth, Zustand and TypeScript.

Auth Pages allows you to view different login page variations.
When you log in, all the page variations become available to view.
I used `next-auth` for allowing users to log in with Github, and I used `zustand`
for mimicking the "sign in with email" functionality to avoid the need for
setting up a backend to store email auth information.

The site is deployed with Vercel.
