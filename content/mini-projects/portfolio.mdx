Built with React, Next.js, Tailwind, Contentlayer and TypeScript.

The purpose of this portfolio is to showcase the projects
and mini projects I've created, as well as the learnings
I've gained along the way.

I used Contentlayer so that I could edit posts
without needing to write a bunch of HTML. I also used
Paco Coursey's <Link href="https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes" target="_blank">
next-themes</Link>
for setting and updating the site's light/dark themes.

The minimalistic style of the home and project pages is from
Paco Coursey's <Link href="https://paco.me/" target="_blank">
portfolio</Link>. The component for
displaying featured projects on the home page is from Jordan Singer's <Link href="http://web.archive.org/web/20220414104749/https://diagram.com/" target="_blank">
old Diagram landing page</Link>.

The site is deployed with Vercel.
