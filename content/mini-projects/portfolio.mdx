Built with React, Next.js, Tailwind, Contentlayer and TypeScript.

The purpose of this portfolio is to showcase the projects
and mini projects I've created, as well as the learnings
I've gained along the way.

I used Contentlayer so that I could edit posts
without needing to write a bunch of HTML. I also used
Paco Coursey's <Link href="https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes" target="_blank">
next-themes</Link>
for setting and updating the site's light/dark themes.

The minimalistic style of the home and project pages is from
Paco Coursey's <Link href="https://paco.me/" target="_blank">
portfolio</Link>. The mini project preview component on the home page
is adapted from Headless UI's <Link href="https://headlessui.com/react/menu#styled-examples" target="_blank">Tailwind UI preview component</Link> and it uses the <Link href="https://heropatterns.com/" target="_blank">topography hero pattern</Link>.

The site is deployed with Vercel.
