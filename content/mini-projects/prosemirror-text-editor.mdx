Built with React, Next.js, Tailwind, ProseMirror and TypeScript.

Prosemirror is a framework agnostic library for building rich text editors.
This mini project adapts code from Prosemirror's <Link href="https://prosemirror.net/examples/basic" target="_blank">
basic editor example</Link>
to build a simple text editor with Next.js and React.

In the editor, you can **bold** and _emphasize_ text with keyboard shortcuts,
paste images, type `"# "` to start a heading element, create lists, and more.

The site is deployed with Vercel.
