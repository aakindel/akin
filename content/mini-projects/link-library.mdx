Built with React, Next.js, Tailwind, Zustand and TypeScript.

This mini project provides a space where you can store web links
in rich link widgets that feature the link title and logo.
I used `url-metadata` for fetching link metadata and `zustand`
for managing the state of the added links.

The site is deployed with Vercel.
