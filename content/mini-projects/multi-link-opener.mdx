Built with React, Next.js, Tailwind, Zustand and TypeScript.

This mini project provides a space where you can open multiple web links
at the same time. The sets of links to be opened are stored with identifying
titles and can be reused to open the same links multiple times.
I used `zustand` for managing the state of the added link sets.

The site is deployed with Vercel.
